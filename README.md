AFK Arena
======

Automated Battle Ground.

Athens
------

Simple Graphics Engine. Built on OpenGL 2.1.

In order to run you need to download the following files from http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/jar/ and place then in the Athens\lib folder:

 * gluegen-rt.jar
 * gluejen-rt-natives-OS-ARCH.jar
 * jogl-all.jar
 * jogl-all-natives-OS-ARCH.jar
 
Where OS is your operating system and ARCH is your system architecture.

NOTE: if you are running 32-bit java you may need the i586 native libs even if your system is 64-bit.
