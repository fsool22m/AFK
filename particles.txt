Particle stuff:
---------------
position
velocity
lifetime

Emitter stuff:
--------------
position + jitter
initial speed + jitter
initial direction + jitter
stopping condition (lifetime ends, velocity reaches X, position reaches X)
spawn rate (use 0 for "explosion")
max number of particles (to do object pooling and the like)
