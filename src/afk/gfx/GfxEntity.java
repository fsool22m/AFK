/**
 * Interface to a graphics entity. A Graphics entity is a visual object with
 * position, rotation, scale and colour. Individual implementations and
 * specialisations may interpret each of these differently, but their
 * meanings should all be straightforward.

 * <em>Note:</em> A graphics entity has an "active" flag, which in most cases
 * will determine the visibility of the entity, but in some cases will mean
 * other things. Please refer to specific implementation documentation for
 * additional information.
